# NEST-JSON: Blogging for Humans

This repository holds a variant of [NEST](https://github.com/hamzeen/nest) (a blogging platform) which uses flat JSON files as its building blocks. 

NEST was built purely with simplicity in mind. Simplicity in its architecture, simplicity in every step of the way till you finally spin up your blog. Yet, it doesn't compromise on scalability as your content grows over time. The first proof of concept for NEST came to life in April 2018.
